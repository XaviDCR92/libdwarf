    * CLEANUP: Now uses distclean so  deleted a few lines here.
    * fixlibdwarfelf.sh: Used by configure to create libdwarf.h
      from libdwarf.h.in
    * generatedcasetext.c: A utility used to generate a ctype-like
      table for converting to uri-style.  The table exists 
      in dwarfdump so this C file likely will not be used again.
