    * FIX-CONFIGURE-TIMES: Added another cautionary
      check before doing anything.

    * FIX-CONFIGURE-TIMES: Was not cautious enough about
      whether it was in the right place and also was fussy
      about the top-level name being 'code'.
      Both issues fixed.

    * CLEANUP: Now uses distclean so  deleted a few lines here.
    * fixlibdwarfelf.sh: Used by configure to create libdwarf.h
      from libdwarf.h.in
    * generatedcasetext.c: A utility used to generate a ctype-like
      table for converting to uri-style.  The table exists 
      in dwarfdump so this C file likely will not be used again.
