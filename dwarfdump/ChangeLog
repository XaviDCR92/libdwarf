2019-04-29 David Anderson
     * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h: Regenerated.
       Version date update.
     * dwarfdump_ta_ext_table.h,dwarfdump-ta-table.h,
       dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-table.h:  Regenerated. 
     * tag_attr_ext.list. Added DW_TAG_class_type
       with common GNU extension DW_AT_containing_type
     * tag_common.h: Increased EXT_ATTR_TABLE_ROWS to 15.
2019-04-28 David Anderson
     * config.h.in.cmake, configure.cmake: Deleted all reference to
       INT32 and INT64 as no longer needed.
2019-04-26 David Anderson
     * config.h.in.cmake,configure.cmake: Now deals
       with DWARF_WITH_LIBELF and more for cmake.
2019-04-25 David Anderson
     * print_die.c: Removed trailing whitespace.
2019-04-25 David Anderson
     * common.c,dwconf.c: Tiny changes to
       avoid compiler warnings.
     * print_die.c: Refactored to avoid annoying
       compiler warning about a fall-through.
2019-04-24 David Anderson
     * command_options.c: Remove trailing space, fold a long line
     * dwarfdump.c: If init failed the message listed
       the wrong function name.
2019-04-22 David Anderson
     * dwarfdump.c: Prevent the -a option from requesting
       Elf section data printing (no section
       data was printed anyway as the request was
       incomplete).
2019-04-22 David Anderson
     * dwarfdump.c: Add test for _MSC_VER for Windows MSVC.
     * print_die.c: Using uintptr_t to suppress a warning.
2019-04-22 David Anderson
     * checkutil.c: Now uses uintptr_t so we can avoid
       compile-time warnings about converting pointer to
       integer.
     * command_options.h: Ifdef a couple of static
       function prototypes so, when regex missing,
       we do not get warnings of undefined static functions.
     * dwarf_tsearchbal.c: Add ifdef-d stdint.h and
       inttypes.h so we can avoid some conversion warnings
       from printf calls.
     * dwarf_alloc.c:  Add ifdef-d stdint.h and
       inttypes.h so we can avoid some conversion warnings
       from printf calls.
2019-04-19 David Anderson
     * Apology. This enhances pubnames-like printing
       and uses non-libelf elf access as much as possible
       (even if libelf present). With --disable-libelf
       it allows all but printing Elf section headers
       and relocation records.  It's excessively large
       for one commit(mainly in libdwarf). Sorry.
     * command_options.c: Conditionalize the help message
       so the Elf section printing is not shown if
       --disable-libelf chosen at configure time.
     * dwarfdump.1: Mention that --disable-libelf removes
       certain elf section header printing options.
     * dwarfdump.c: Implements the elf reading changes.
     * print_strings.c: Fixed a printf to use sanitized()
       so we don't print non-ascii (we use uri form instead).
2019-03-08 David Anderson
     * print_pubnames.c: Remove trailing whitespace.
2019-03-07 David Anderson
     * print_pubnames.c(print_all_pubnames_style_records): A
       struct esb_s was constructed and filled but then never
       destructed, leading to a memory leak. Eliminated it 
       entirely.
2019-03-04 David Anderson
     * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h,
       dwarfdump-ta-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h,
       dwarfdump-tt-table.h,dwarf_names_enum.h,
       dwarf_names_new.h: Regenerated with latest date string
       and version.
     * dwarfdump.c: Corrected indent mistakes.
     * glflags.h: Removed blank line.
     * globals.h: Added print_all_pubnames_style_records() declaration
       so all the pubnames-like sections are printed by just one
       function.
     * print_die.c: Fixed indents. Removed trailing whitespace.
     * print_pubnames.c: Now has the print code for all the
       pubnames-like sections. The pubnames-like section
       names only print if there is some data.  We now
       also (for those sections) print the section CU-headers
       if dwarfdump -v.   Some error messages modified slightly
       to show the correct section name (as opposed to leaving it
       off). Now can do the coded checks instead of ignoring them.  
     * print_sections.c: Moved deal_with_name_offset_err() over
       to print_pubnames.c, where it is now a static function.
     * print_sections.h: Removed declarations of deal_with_name_offset_err()
       and print_pubname_style_entry() as those are now static functions
       in print_pubnames.c.
     * print_static_funcs.c, print_static_vars.c: Now only print 
       section name if there
       is content. Corrected a long-incorrect section name of this
       SGI-extension section you most likely have never seen.
       Deleted the old printing code, do it via call into
       print_pubnames.c.
     * print_types.c,print_weaknames.c: Now only prints 
       section name if there is content.
       Deleted the old printing code, do it via call into
       print_pubnames.c.

2019-02-24 David Anderson
     * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h,
       dwarfdump-ta-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h,
       dwarfdump-tt-table.h,dwarf_names_enum.h,
       dwarf_names_new.h: Regenerated with latest date string
       and version.
2019-02-19 David Anderson
     * configure.cmake: Now defines DWARF_WITH_LIBELF
       so builds work as always.
     * dwarfdump.c,globals.h,print_reloc.c: Now uses
       DWARF_WITH_LIBELF to determine how to build
       with or without libelf.
2019-02-12 David Anderson
     * print_die.c: Delete _dwarf_memcpy_swap_bytes() as it
       is no longer needed. Use the new 
       dwarf_uncompress_integer_block_a() interface as it
       is easier to use.
2019-02-07 David Anderson
     * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarfdump-ta-table.h,
       dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h, dwarfdump-tt-table.h:
       Just a changed version string.
2019-02-07 David Anderson
     * dwarfdump.c: Use ifdef HAVE_ELF_H so non-elf
       builds work.
     * print_reloc.c: ifdef HAVE_ELF_H, eliminating
       the entire file of elf-header printing if elf.h
       missing.
2019-01-31 David Anderson
     * dwarfdump.c,dwconf.c,esb.c,print_abbrevs.c,
       print_aranges.c,print_die.c,print_macro.c,
       print_reloc.c,print_str_offsets.c: Fix warnings
       emitted by llvm's scan-build tool.
2019-01-20 David Anderson
    * globals.h: Remove the code for *UINT* and
      all the ifdefs involved. No longer needed.
    * print_die.c(get_FLAG_BLOCK_string): Remove 
      the__int32_t from this function (associated with
      DW_AT_SUN_func_offsets).  Simplify the printing
      of these offsets. 
2019-01-14 David Anderson
    * dwarf_names.c, dwarf_names.h,dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h,
      dwarfdump-ta-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h,
      dwarfdump-tt-table.h: Regenerated.
    * print_lines.c: If missing a line number do not
      supply a meaningless -1, supply 0.
      If line table access gets an error, print the error
      and attempt to continue.
    * dwarfdump.c: We try to continue after major errors
      in more places. If any major errors were seen
      a final line of text is reported to standard-out.
2019-01-02 David Anderson
    * ChangeLog: renamed ChangeLog 2018.
    * Makefile.am: Added ChangeLog2018 to distribution files.
