    * Remove some tabs in Changelog.
    * For the Windows version, turn on the buffering for the stdout stream;
      being off, caused a dramatic slowdown when sending the output over a
      network drive.
    * 32-bits values being printed using the I64 specification. Warning from
      the MS compiler.
2018-05-15 David Anderson
    * tmp-tt-table.c,tmp-ta-table.c,tmp-ta-ext-table.c, 
      tmp-tt-ext-table.c: All endings changed from .c to .h 
      as these are all used via #include.
    * Makefile.in: Reflect the .c->.h change for these files.
    * checkutil.c,dwarf_tsearch.h,dwarf_tsearchbal.c,
      glflags.c,naming.c,naming.h,print_debugfission.c,
      print_die.c,print_frames.c,print_gdbindex.c,print_macros.c,
      print_pubnames.c,print_reloc.h,print_sections.c,
      print_static_vars.c,uri.c,uritablebuild.c: 
      Removed trailing blank lines.
2018-05-15 David Anderson
    * command_options.c: Removed an extra break on option -ER
      that was an accident. It's been broken for quite a long time.
      section_map[DW_HDR_DEBUG_RNGLISTS]=TRUE, applicable
      to DWARF5, was getting ignored due to the mistake.
      This has to do with printing section header information.
2018-05-14 David Anderson
    * command_options.c,compiler_info.c,print_frames.c: Fix
      indents, remove trailing whitespace.
2018-05-14 David Anderson
    * dwarfdump.c,tag_attr.c,tag_tree.c, common.c:
      Update version string
2018-05-14 David Anderson
    * print_frames.c: Validate augmentation bytes from
      eh_frame to catch bogus augmentation length.
2018-05-14 David Anderson
    * dwarfdump.c: gcc caught a memset given a pointer
      as the size. Fixed.
    * naming.c: Needed #ifndef TRIVIAL_NAMING
      around skipunder() to compile without warnings.
    * section_bitmaps.c, section_bitmaps.h: Needed 
      (void) as function argument list, for example
      set_all_sections_on(void) .
2018-05-14 Carlos Alberto Enciso
    * Rename producer_info.[ch] to compiler_info.[ch].
2018-05-11 Carlos Alberto Enciso
    * New files: command_options.c,command_options.h
      Command line arguments processing; the original code moved
      from dwarfdump.c.
    * New files: producer_info.c,producer_info.h
      Record statistics about the producers (compilers). The original
      code moved from dwarfdump.c.
    * glflags.c,glflags.h,globals.h:
      Moved the remaining individual global flags and what they
      control into glflags.h.
    * section_bitmaps.c,section_bitmaps.h: process the header and
      relocation maps. Original code moved from dwarfdump.c
    * dwarfdump.c:
      Moved the code for command line arguments processing to
      command_options.c and producer_info.c.
    * print_reloc.c,sanitized.h,defined_types.h,dwconf.c,print_aranges.c
      Minor changes due to refactoring of the command line and
      producer refactoring.
2018-05-09 David Anderson
    * common.c,dwarfdump.c,glflags.c,glflags.h,print_aranges.c,
      print_die.c: Fixed indents to match dicheck requirements
      and removed some trailing whitespace.
2018-05-01 Carlos Alberto Enciso
    * common.c,dwarfdump.c,dwconf.c,glflags.c,glflags.h,globals.h,
      naming.c,print_abbrevs.c,print_aranges.c,print_die.c,
      print_dnames.c,print_frames.c,print_gdbindex.c,print_lines.c,
      print_locs.c,print_macro.c,print_macros.c,print_pubnames.c,
      print_ranges.c,print_static_funcs.c,print_static_vars.c,
      print_strings.c,print_weaknames.c,tag_attr.c,tag_tree.c:
      Moved the remaining individual global flags and what they
      control into glflags.h, making it easier to understand
      what one is looking at when reading the code.
2018-04-22 David Anderson
    * print_str_offsets.c: Created consistent terminology
      for the parts of a table and reflecting that in
      the table output. The DWARF5 standard uses more
      than one set of terms for the section contents.
    * dwarfdump.c,tag_attr.c,tag_tree.c:
      Update version string
    * common.c: Update version string. 
      Now that  usage text in full is only on request 
      it now becomes stdout instead of stderr.
2018-04-19 David Anderson
    * Makefile.in: Added additional lines to test native
      getopt_long to verify dwgetopt_long works consistently
      with GNU getopt_long (for the features tested, anyway).
    * dwgetopt.c: Better checking for dwgetopt_long correctness.
    * getopttest.c: Added tests and revised the checking to
      avoid nasty corner cases.
2018-04-17 David Anderson
    * dwarfdump.c, dwarfdump.1: The -h option has not been supported
      for years (it printed an IRIX table of no interest now)
      so now -h means print the help message showing the options
      available.
    * dwgetopt.c: Now prints the name of any incorrect long-option
      it sees and prints if user-specified =arg
      on a long option violates requirements . For either returns -1.
      Should have done that all along.
    * getopttest.c: Added tests and revised the checking functions
      to show all the relevant data if a test fails.  Added line number
      of the original test to the output so it's easier to find
      the actual test.
2018-04-16 David Anderson
    * common.c,dwarfdump.c,tag_attr.c,tag_tree.c:
      Update version string
2018-04-14 David Anderson
    * dwarfdump.1: Add --print-str-offsets.
    * dwarfdump.c: Add --print-str-offsets to the usage text.
2018-04-13 David Anderson
    * CMakeLists.txt: Added new source files to cmake info.
2018-04-13 David Anderson
    * common.c,tag_attr.c,tag_tree.c: Updated
      version string.
    * configure.ac: Added a comment about HAVE_LOCATION_OF_LIBELFHEADER
    * dwarfdump.c:  Added support for option --print_str_offsets
      to print .debug_str_offsets.
      Updated version string.
    * glflags.h: Added new flag: boolean gf_print_str_offsets.
    * globals.h: Added print function print_str_offsets_section()
      to interfaces.
    * print_str_offsets.c: New code to print the .debug_str_offsets
      section independent of anything else.
    * Makefile.in: Added print_str_offsets.o to targets.
2018-04-06 David Anderson
    * configure.ac: Previous recent change introduced a mistake.
      Now we set HAVE_ELF64_R_INFO as intended all along.
    * configure: Regenerated
2018-04-02 David Anderson
    * CMakeLists.txt: Added defined_types.h to the set_source_group
      HEADERS list, but cmake is not currently working
      with libdwarf or dwarfdump.
    * configure.ac: Removed AC_CHECK_LIB and replaced
      with the newer AC_SEARCH_LIBS.
      Removed two cases using HAVE_LOCATION_OF_LIBELF_HEADER
      that never worked, it seems.
    * configure: Regenerated
2018-03-29 David Anderson
    * configure.ac: Corrected AC_CHECK_HEADERS use.
      Removed AC_TRY_COMPILE in favor of AC_COMPILE_IFELSE.

    * configure: regenerated
    * config.h.in: regenerated
2018-03-28 David Anderson

    * configure: regenerated.
    * Makefile.in: Support for cross compiling
2018-03-25 David Anderson
    * defined_types.h,dwarfdump/dwarfdump.c,esb.c,esb.h,
      globals.h,print_aranges.c,print_die.c,print_frames.c,
      print_lines.c,print_macro.c,print_macros.c,
      print_ranges.c, sanitized.c,sanitized.h,uri.h:
      Updated copyright year on the merged changes.
    * getopttest.c: Fixed compiler warnings (this
      is just for selftest, not usually compiled).
2018-03-25 Carlos Alberto Enciso:
    * many: Merged header simplifications into master.
2018-03-24 David Anderson
    * print_lines.c: Now uses dwarf_srclines_files_indexes()
      to simplify printing of DWARF2,3,4 and 5 line headers
      in a simple uniform way.
2018-03-22 David Anderson
    * print_lines.c: Now works with DWARF5 line table,
      showing correct file index for all versions.
