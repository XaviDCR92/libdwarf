  dwarfdump.conf is now installed by make install
  in <install prefix>/shared/libdwarf/dwarfdump  .
  Any  dwarfdump.conf or .dwarfdump.conf in your
  $HOME directory will be found before the
  one in shared.  The file is only opened when
  one wants a more accurate register naming in frame
  reports (the default is just to name things r54 
  etc, choosing the right abi with -x abi=<something>
  can be helpful at times).

  The configure has been completely rewritten to follow
  current standards and practices. For simple builds
  the standard
    ./configure
    make
  works as always, but the generated libdwarf.a appears
  in libdwarf/.libs/libdwarf.a , as does the shared object
  if "./configure --enable-shared" is used.
  
  To build dwarfgen one adds the configure option --enable-dwarfgen
    instead of using 'make all'.
  To build the example code one adds the configure option 
    --enable-dwarfexample  instead of using 'make all'.

  "mkdir /tmp/bld ; cd /tmp/bld ; <sourcebase>/configure"
  continues to work, as does configure --host=<name>  .
2018-06-14:
  A small simplification of build options simplifies building
  across different environments.  If your environment needs
  to use the non-standard elf_open() call instead of unix/linux open()
  then do <path>/configure --enable-elf-open which sets
  HAVE_ELF_OPEN in config.h.
2018-03-27:
  All the DWARF5 FORMs appear to be dealt with.
  It's now possible to cross-compile libdwarf and dwarfdump.
  See the README.
2016-11-30:
  An alternative build mechanism using cmake is now in the source tree.
  The builds for product testing continue to be done using configure && make.
2016-09-20:
  --enable-sanitize option added to configure. This builds
  with -fsanitize=address to check for out of bounds
  memory access. 
2016-09-05:
  dwarfexample/simpleexample.c now has a simple option letting one
  extract all .debug_info, .debug_types strings into a file by
  themselves in case one wanted to examine string frequencies,
  for example.
2016-06-01:  Now we use DW_VERSION_DATE_STR for
  dates everywhere instead of __DATE__ __TIME__
  so a repeated build gets identical object output.
  DW_VERSION_DATE_STR is updated by UPDATEDWARFDUMPVERSION.sh
  wherever that string is needed.
  
2015-11-26:  If DWARF section data you intend to read
  with libdwarf is compressed by zlib (a section name
  like  .zdebug_info indicates such compression) libdwarf etc
  will need zlib's headers and archive or shared-library
  at build and link time. If you  do not have zlib
  everything will compile fine and will work
  on ordinary DWARF sections but libdwarf will not be
  able to read .zdebug_ compressed sections.
  zlib.h is the main zlib header and libz.a is the
  most likely zlib library you will encounter.

2015-11-15:  It is now possible to build
  outside of the source tree. See README.
  So configure.in changed a little.
2015-01-13:  Removed dwarfdump2 and references to it.
  dwarfdump has the (tsearch) features needed so the C++
  version no longer a benefit.
