     * config.h.in.cmake, configure.cmake: Deleted all reference to
       INT32 and INT64 as no longer needed.
2019-04-26 David Anderson
     * config.h.in.cmake,configure.cmake: Now deals with
       latest cmake libdwarf options.
2019-04-25 David Anderson
     * createirepfrombinary.cc: Corrected the test for _MSC_VER.
2019-04-22 David Anderson
     * createirepfrombinary.cc: Add test for _MSC_VER for Windows MSVC.
2019-03-07 David Anderson
     * irepdie.h: The IRAttr assignment constructor
       had a memory leak. Fixed.
     * general.h: Added #ifndef GENERAL_H to make inclusion
       idempotent.
     * ireptodbg.cc: Using new IRAattr member function
       dropFormData to ensure immediate delete of formdata_.
       Not really needed since it would eventually be
       delete-d anyway by the destructor.
2019-03-04 David Anderson
     * dwarfgen.cc: Updated the comment about the libdwarf interface
       call return values.
     * irepattrtodbg.cc: Changed the libdwarf producer function calls
       to be the newer version returning an int as that version
       is simpler to work with. The old interfaces still exist
       and work the same as always.
     * irepdie.h: setFormData() was failing to account for
       a replacement value of formdata_, which could leak
       memory.
     * ireptodbg.cc: Replaced calls to libdwarf producer that
       returned DW_DLV_NOCOUNT or DW_DLV_BADADDR with the ones
       returning an int for improved readability of the code.
       The old functions still exist and work as always but
       we're not using them here.
2019-02-18 David Anderson
     * configure.cmake: Now defines DWARF_WITH_LIBELF
       for consistency with other cmake files.
     * dwarfgen.cc: Trivial comment correction.
2019-02-12 David Anderson
     * dwarfgen.cc: The new option --add-sun-func-offsets
       tests whether the DW_AT_SUN_func_offsets data can
       be written (and later read) properly.
     * general.h: Added bool addSUNfuncoffsets.
     * irepattrtodbg.cc: Now we handle DW_FORM_CLASS_BLOCK.
     * irepform.h: Refine IRFormBlock to make it usable.
     * ireptodbg.cc: When requested, add a 
       DW_AT_SUN_func_offsets attribute to a compile unit.
2019-02-08 David Anderson
     * ireptodbg.cc: std::list<Dwarf_Unsigned> adval
       was using a non-portable initializer. Now using
       standard C++ list initializer.
2019-01-31 David Anderson
     * dwarfgen.cc,dwarfgen/ireptodbg.cc: Fixing issues
       reported by the llvm scan-build tool. 
2019-01-20 David Anderson
     * dwarfgen.cc: Remove use of uint32_t and uint64_t
       and use Dwarf_Unsigned for arithmetic.
2019-01-14 David Anderson
     * createirepfrombinary.cc: Made a partial step toward
       being able to read eh_frame, but those few lines
       are ignored for now.
     * dwarfgen.cc,general.h: Adding --add-frame-advance-loc option
       which causes testing of the new DW_CFA_advance_loc
       emitting code (better portability of the code).
     * irepframe.h: Changed index results from signed
       to unsigned. Negative values never meant anything.
     * irepresentation.h: Added code for eh_frame.
     * ireptodbg.cc: We now use the improved DW_DLV_OK
       producer calls so we changed away from allowing
       indexes to be negative, we do not need to allow
       that any longer.  Now uses the latest libdwarf
       producer calls for frame data.
       If --add-frame-advance-loc then emit particular
       values of advance_loc to test the code paths
       in the DW_CFA_advance_loc* logic.
       We create a whole new cie/fde pair for  the new
       fde testing output.

     * ChangeLog: Renamed ChangeLog2018
     * Makefile.am: Addec ChangeLog2018 to dist files.
