    * Makefile.am, dwarfdump/Makefile.am, dwarfexample/Makefile.am,
      dwarfgen/Makefile.am: cmake and configure
      needed to agree on the list of files. Specifically
      configure.ac etc lists just cmake files that
      exist so it can generate a complete
      release, while CmakeLists.txt etc will not currently
      generate a complete release.  Regenerated configure.in.
2019-05-05  David Anderson
    * configure.ac,configure.cmake: Version 20190505
    * configure: regenerated
2019-05-02  David Anderson
    * scripts/buildstandardsource.sh: cmake has serious trouble
      with semicolons so now this copies the base 
      libdwarf.h.in to generated_libdwarf.in while changing
      struct Elf to struct _Elf. cmake can do a simple copy.
    * configure.cmake: Now just copies the right file with
      Elf or _Elf to libdwarf.h.
    * scripts/buildstandardsource.sh: Now creates
      generated_libdwarf.h.in from libdwarf.h.in.
      using sed. Run by developer, not library users.
    * scripts/fixlibdwarfelf.sh Now just copies the 
      right file with Elf or _Elf to libdwarf.h
      (used by configure, not cmake).
2019-05-02  David Anderson
    * Makefile.in: regenerated.
2019-05-01  David Anderson
    * CMakeLists.txt: Sets language C
    * cmake/AutoconfHelper.cmake: deleted, nothing here
      used any more.
    * cmake/FindLibElf.cmake: Now does C source test, not c++.
    * configure.cmake: moved the cmake macro includes to
      the first lines in the file.  Added a JUST_LIBELF
      variable to correctly test for off64_t
      Does checking/setting for essentially all the needed HAVE_
      etc variables.
      
2019-05-01  David Anderson
    * README.cmake: Made more complete.
    * configure.cmake: Even more setup here.
2019-05-01  David Anderson
    * CMakeLists.txt: Corrected a mistake in reporting install
      prefix.
    * cmake/AutoconfHelper.cmake: Removed unused functions,
      and for some functions changed to native cmake
      in configure.cmake.
    * configure.cmake: Now does a lot more setup here and
      using cmake (replacing some autoconf-like functions)
      And this now sets many things for each build directory,
      reducing the size of */configure.cmake files. 
2019-04-30  David Anderson
    * README.cmake: New, describes use of cmake.
    * cmake/LibdwarfMacros.cmake: Added a final newline
      charcter as such is expected.
    * configure.cmake: Added testing lines.
2019-04-26  David Anderson
    * README.cmake. New. Describes cmake use and options.
    * CMakeLists.txt,cmake/FindLibElf.cmake,configure.cmake:
      Revised to be closer to configure as to what
      it does.
2019-04-25  David Anderson
    * configure.ac: Version 20190425. Updated 
      to recognize recent changes. And some
      #include/define updates for Windows.
2019-04-22  David Anderson
    * configure.ac: Version 20190422. Now tests for
      stdint.h and inttypes.h. Uses AC_TYPE_UINTPTR_T
      so we can avoid a lot of warnings in 32bit and
      mingw builds.
2019-04-21  David Anderson
    * configure.ac: Version 20190421. Now --enable-nonstandardprintf
      (build with some non-standard printf formats allowed)
      adds -Wno-pedantic-ms-format so gcc will not warn
      about the non-standard formats. Only affects mingw.
      Otherwise the -Wno-pedantic-ms-format option
      (which nothing but mingw has) gets dropped.
2019-04-19  David Anderson
    * NEWS: Now --disable-libelf just disables linking
      with libelf.  Elf files are read (libdwarf) and
      printf(dwarfdump). As always. The Elf reader detects
      corrupted Elf early on. 
2019-02-24  David Anderson
    * configure.ac. Version 20190223. With --disable-libelf
      most header checking is unnecessary and suppressed. 
      All the checks for int32 and the like removed 
      as we no longer use such types.
2019-02-18  David Anderson
    * configure.ac: One can build forcing a non-elf build with
      --disable-libelf . If libelf is missing or will not compile
      the disable is automatic.  Now zlib is separated so
      -lz is added to the link line with or without libelf.
      Version is 20190217
    * configure.cmake: Now always defines DWARF_WITH_LIBELF
      so cmake builds continue to work as always.
2019-02-07  David Anderson
    * configure.ac. Version 20190201. Now allows lack of
      elf.h libelf.h and if those and zlib.h missing
      then the link line shows neither -lelf nor -lz
      (libdwarf and dwarfdump will then support PE
      and mach-o objects but not elf)
2019-01-15  David Anderson
    * configure.ac: Version 20190112
2019-01-10  David Anderson
    * configure.ac: Version 20190110
2019-01-09  David Anderson
    * configure.ac: Version 20190108
2019-01-05  David Anderson
    * configure.ac: Version 20190104
2019-01-02  David Anderson
    * ChangeLog: renamed ChangeLog2018
    * configure.ac: Version 20190102
    * Makefile.am: Now includes the tsearch files in the dist.
