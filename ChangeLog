    * README.cmake. New. Describes cmake use and options.
    * CMakeLists.txt,cmake/FindLibElf.cmake,configure.cmake:
      Revised to be closer to configure as to what
      it does.
2019-04-25  David Anderson
    * configure.ac: Version 20190425. Updated 
      to recognize recent changes. And some
      #include/define updates for Windows.
2019-04-22  David Anderson
    * configure.ac: Version 20190422. Now tests for
      stdint.h and inttypes.h. Uses AC_TYPE_UINTPTR_T
      so we can avoid a lot of warnings in 32bit and
      mingw builds.
2019-04-21  David Anderson
    * configure.ac: Version 20190421. Now --enable-nonstandardprintf
      (build with some non-standard printf formats allowed)
      adds -Wno-pedantic-ms-format so gcc will not warn
      about the non-standard formats. Only affects mingw.
      Otherwise the -Wno-pedantic-ms-format option
      (which nothing but mingw has) gets dropped.

    * NEWS: Now --disable-libelf just disables linking
      with libelf.  Elf files are read (libdwarf) and
      printf(dwarfdump). As always. The Elf reader detects
      corrupted Elf early on. 
2019-02-24  David Anderson
    * configure.ac. Version 20190223. With --disable-libelf
      most header checking is unnecessary and suppressed. 
      All the checks for int32 and the like removed 
      as we no longer use such types.
2019-02-18  David Anderson
    * configure.ac: One can build forcing a non-elf build with
      --disable-libelf . If libelf is missing or will not compile
      the disable is automatic.  Now zlib is separated so
      -lz is added to the link line with or without libelf.
      Version is 20190217
    * configure.cmake: Now always defines DWARF_WITH_LIBELF
      so cmake builds continue to work as always.
2019-02-07  David Anderson
    * configure.ac. Version 20190201. Now allows lack of
      elf.h libelf.h and if those and zlib.h missing
      then the link line shows neither -lelf nor -lz
      (libdwarf and dwarfdump will then support PE
      and mach-o objects but not elf)
